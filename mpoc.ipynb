      "#### Main Goals:\n",
      "1. **Acknowledge the Incident**: Ensure the incident is recognized and assigned.\n",
      "2. **Gather Context**: Collect relevant information about the incident.\n",
      "3. **Diagnose the Issue**: Identify the root cause of the incident.\n",
      "4. **Implement a Fix**: Apply a solution to resolve the incident.\n",

      "7. **Conduct a Post-Mortem**: Analyze the incident to improve future responses.\n",

      "#### Subgoals:\n",
      "- Communicate with the team.\n",
      "- Access relevant logs and metrics.\n",

      "- Collaborate with other teams if necessary.\n",

      "- Gather context.\n",
      "- Diagnose the issue.\n",
      "- Implement a fix.\n",
      "- Verify resolution.\n",
      "- Document the incident.\n",
      "- Conduct a post-mortem.\n",

      "3. Review monitoring dashboards for anomalies.\n",
      "4. Check recent changes in configurations or deployments.\n",

      "8. Document the incident and resolution steps.\n",
      "9. Schedule a post-mortem meeting.\n",

      "### Step 6: Observation\n",
      "Completing the first task revealed that the incident was escalated to the on-call engineer, and they are now aware of the situation. I will need to adjust my approach slightly to ensure effective communication.\n",

      "### Step 7: Thought\n",
      "Based on the results so far, I should modify my plan to be more effective. I will re-evaluate the next steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Action\n",
      "Revise the plan by ensuring that all team members are informed via Slack and that a dedicated channel is created for incident updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 9: Observation\n",
      "The revised approach is working better because team members are actively contributing information and insights, which is speeding up the diagnosis process. I'm making good progress towards the overall goal.\n",

      "Summarize the key steps taken and provide the final solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 12: Observation\n",
      "The solution is:\n",
      "1. **Acknowledge the Incident**: Confirmed in PagerDuty and notified the team via Slack.\n",
      "2. **Gather Context**: Collected logs from affected clusters and namespaces using `kubectl logs` and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.\n",
      "3. **Diagnose the Issue**: Analyzed logs and metrics to identify a misconfigured deployment.\n",
      "4. **Implement a Fix**: Corrected the deployment configuration and redeployed the affected services.\n",
      "5. **Verify Resolution**: Monitored the services to ensure they are functioning correctly and confirmed with the team.\n",
      "6. **Document the Incident**: Recorded all actions taken, findings, and resolutions in the incident management system.\n",
      "7. **Conduct a Post-Mortem**: Scheduled a meeting to discuss the incident, its impact, and preventive measures for the future.\n",
      "\n",
